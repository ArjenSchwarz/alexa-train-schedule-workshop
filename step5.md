# Step 5: More ideas

Some additional ideas you can play with in this workshop.

* Check if you can fit in the train or if it's already filled to capacity.
* Create a dialog that gives you all the information about your train.
* Create a session where it remembers who you are.
* Create an interface for visual Alexa enabled devices that provides the answers to your questions on the screen.
* Store the results in sessions to ensure follow up questions use the same data.

Try some of these out, or come up with your own ideas for this or your very own skill. But mostly, have fun!
